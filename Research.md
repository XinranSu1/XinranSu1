## Bootstrapping for Matrix Models
 Matrix models are physical models in which the dynamical quantities are square matrices, and are usually taken at the limit when the size of matrix tends to infinity. In 1997, Banks, Fischler, Shenker, and Susskind proposed that the large N limit of a supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics model should describe all of M-theory in a light-front coordinate system. It's called BFSS matrix model. The model is being widely studyed to understand the M theory and holographic dualitiy to D0 black hole. Bootstrap method is a modern technique to solve non-perturbative physical models by checking the consistency of a theory.
