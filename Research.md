## Bootstrapping for Matrix Models
 Matrix models are physical models in which the dynamical quantities are square matrices, and are usually taken at the limit when the size of matrix tends to infinity. In 1997, Banks, Fischler, Shenker, and Susskind proposed that the large N limit of a supersymmetric matrix quantum mechanics model should describe all of M-theory in a light-front coordinate system. It's called BFSS matrix model. The model is being widely studyed to understand the M theory and holographic dualitiy to D0 black hole. Bootstrap method is a modern technique to solve non-perturbative physical models by checking the consistency of a theory.

Our research concentrates on how to use bootstrap methods on matrix models, especially the BFSS matrix model. Our target is to derive more accurate bootstrap bound on correlation functions of the BFSS matrix model, by developing systematically bootstrap method and imposing more constraints.
